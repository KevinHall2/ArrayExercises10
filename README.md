 I've had trouble with repos, so this is iteration 10 of the project.
This program lets you input 5 index values. Type out a number (positive or negative) and hit the enter key for each index value.
The program will then list out the values in the order you inputted them in, the values in the reverse order, the sum of the values, the highest value, and the lowest value.
